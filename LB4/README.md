## SOLID Principles

This task focuses on the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. The SOLID principles are a set of five design
principles that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems. Each principle
focuses on a specific aspect of software design and development.

### CLI TODO Application

The task is to implement a simple CLI TODO application that follows the SOLID principles.
The application should allow users to add, complete and remove TODO items.
The application should follow the SOLID principles.

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should have only one reason to change.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Classes should be open for extension (new functionality) but closed for modification (existing functionality).

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the behavior of the
      program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should
      not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
